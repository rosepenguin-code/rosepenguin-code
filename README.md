## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm Leonor — a curious mind diving into tech, especially **cybersecurity**.  
Still at the beginning of the journey, but hungry to learn and eager to break (ethical) stuff. 😎

---

## 🚀 What I'm Aiming For

- Remote work where I can use my brain more than my legs 🧠  
- Help make the digital world a little safer 🔐  
- Prove that a disability doesn't define limits — I do.

---

## 🎮 When I'm not studying or debugging life...

- I play **League of Legends** (cheaper than therapy 💀)  
- I paint stuff — like, actual art, not just walls 🎨  
- I read books to escape reality 📚  
- And sometimes I fight with code until it listens (or I cry) 🤖
